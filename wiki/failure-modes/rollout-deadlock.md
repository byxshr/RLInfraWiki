# Rollout deadlock

## Failure description
Generation and update locks wait on each other.

## Detection
Require explicit logs, counters, or schema checks that would reveal the failure in a small review scenario.

## Mitigation
Prefer fail-closed behavior, explicit version metadata, bounded retries, and rollback or fallback paths.

## Validation checklist
Tie this failure to a validation-pattern page before promoting a design.
