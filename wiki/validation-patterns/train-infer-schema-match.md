# Train infer schema match

## Purpose
Check rollout output fields match trainer batch input fields.

## Minimal check
A review-ready task should include a small deterministic or structural command/log that would fail if this invariant is broken.

## Evidence required
Record command, expected result, artifact path, and whether the result is local verification or only source-reported design intent.
